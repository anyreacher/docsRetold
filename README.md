# docsRetold

Summarize text from documents, websites, images, videos using AI.

Summarize your information using facebook's [Bart(large)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn) model fine-tuned on large summarization dataset - [cnn_dailymail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail).

Goal of summarizing is to save user's time and still give him the key information from the information source. It prevents user of spending too much time reading the information he's not gonna remember anyways and give him just the essential one.

Current available information sources: text
